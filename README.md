They sought the help of Team-3 Agency to analyze the dataset of wine quality that has 6449 wine Ids. Based on the quality ratings in the dataset, Team-3 Agency’s task is to provide Tasty Wine with the hidden trends and patterns in what makes a good wine based on its ingredients so that they can manufacture quality wine for export. The Agency is using Unsupervised Machine Learning to find what ingredients affect the quality of wine.
