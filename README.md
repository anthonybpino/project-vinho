## Background


Tasty Wine manufacturing company wants to enhance their taste of wine and supply it to European countries to expand their business. They sought the help of Team-3 Agency to analyze the dataset of wine quality that has 6449 wine Ids. Based on the quality ratings in the dataset, Team-3 Agencyâ€™s task is to provide Tasty Wine with the hidden trends and patterns in what makes a good wine based on its ingredients so that they can manufacture quality wine for export. The Agency is using Unsupervised Machine Learning to find what ingredients affect the quality of wine.

## Cleaning And Exploring
The first thing we did was to clean the data. We used SQLAlchemy, created an engine that can connect to the database and queried the data and created a dataframe. We dropped duplicate items and dropped unwanted column. Then started the data exploration where we started the comparision between density and other wine ingredients like- fixed acidity, citric acid, chlorides, total sulferdioxide, ph value, alcohol content, volatile acidity, free sulfurdioxide, residual sugar, sulphates and quality.
